# FSD04-internship
Logging my daily tasks for my FSD04 internship with John Abbott College/CERASP

Throughout the course of this internship, I will help with a project that involves developing virtual reality and associated artificial intelligence for the bio-pharmaceutical production and pharmacy technology sectors. Specifically, I will build a website the public may access to learn about the project.
